# TestTask_PortaOne

We have a file with a large set of integers (the file can be downloaded at the link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LxSB6UEAVK0NLgU0ah5y0CBbD0gL_oO9/  ). 

The task is to find the following four/six values:
- the maximum number in the file; 
- the minimum number in the file; 
- the median ( https://goo.gl/hiCwVw  ); 
- average arithmetic value ( https://goo.gl/XJeAjZ  ); 

task with *
- the largest sequence of numbers (that follow each other) that increases (optionally) by 
- the largest (consecutive) sequence of numbers that is decreasing (optional) 

The proposed solution method should find all four/six values from a file in no more than 90 seconds.
This condition is optional, but it will be a significant plus if your solution satisfies it.

You are practically not limited in the choice of method and way of solving the problem. You may use any means, methods,
approaches (except for the two limitations below). You can write the program in any programming language you know, or
you can use existing programs/utilities. Of course, you can use ready-made sets of statistical 
classes/functions/libraries, but this is not the best option. 

There are only the following limitations to consider when choosing a way to solve a problem: 

Limitation #1: 
Anyone should be able to use your method. This means, for example, if you used your own program to solve a task, then
any other person should be able to compile/run it, etc.; if you used third-party programs/utilities, any person should
be able to install and use them as well; also, any person can take a completely different file with a different set of
integers and find all four specified values); 
    
Limitation #2: 
You cannot use illegal software (proprietary software that has been hacked, pirated software, etc.) to solve the
problem. Also, if you borrowed a solution idea, software, or original sources (or some part of them) from a 
friend/colleague/on the Internet/wherever, please mention the source.
